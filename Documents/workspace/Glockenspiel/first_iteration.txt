Hi there,

Here is my first iteration of the Glockenspiel game:
-	For now, our game only supports the 10” device (Nexus 10, my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, etc…)
-	All buttons are customized and are implemented with one sample mp3 file (only waiting for mp3 files from Dr. Kelland)
-	Erik will be continue working with playing patterns from this activity
-	I will be working on the main menu activity.
-	Below is the setup for AVD to test run this project
Our plan at the moment is to make a demo version of this game where the player can selects the level and start playing the patterns. Please let me know your opinions/suggestions regarding this iteration.
